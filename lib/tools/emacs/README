User configuration notes
========================

Below is a quick guide to necessary configurations for getting
started with the Erlang mode for Emacs. Please refer to the
Users guide and reference manual in the documentation for the
Erlang/OTP application tools for more information.


For UNIX users
--------------

To set up the Erlang Emacs mode on UNIX systems, edit/create the file
.emacs in the your home directory.
    
Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs
provided that OTP is installed in the directory /usr/local/otp:
        
      (setq load-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs"
      load-path))
      (setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/otp")
      (setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/bin" exec-path))
      (require 'erlang-start)

To enable 'flymake mode', which performs on-the-fly syntax checking as
you type, add this after the code above:

      (add-hook 'erlang-mode-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (flymake-mode)
                   (local-set-key (kbd "M-'") 'erlang-flymake-next-error)
                   ))

And then flymake mode will be automatically enabled when you load any .erl
file. Use Alt-' to move the cursor to the next error discovered by flymake.


For Windows users
-----------------
   
To set up the Erlang Emacs mode on Windows systems, edit/create the
file .emacs, the location of the file depends on the configuration of
the system. If the HOME environment variable is set, Emacs will look
for the .emacs file in the directory indicated by the HOME
variable. If HOME is not set, Emacs will look for the .emacs file in
C:\.
    
Below is a complete example of what should be added to a user's .emacs
provided that OTP is installed in the directory C:\Program
Files\erl-<Ver>:
      
      (setq load-path (cons  "C:/Program Files/erl<Ver>/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs"
      load-path))
      (setq erlang-root-dir "C:/Program Files/erl<Ver>")
      (setq exec-path (cons "C:/Program Files/erl<Ver>/bin" exec-path))
      (require 'erlang-start)
